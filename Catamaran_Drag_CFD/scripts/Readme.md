## Scripts

### MATLAB
- `drag_vs_velocity_qaudratic_fit.m`
  Fits CFD drag data to a quadratic drag model  
  \[
  D = k V^2
  \]
  Used for extracting drag coefficients for control and performance analysis.

### CFD Post-Processing
- `plot_drag_vs_velocity.m`  
  Generates drag vs velocity plots from Fluent results.
